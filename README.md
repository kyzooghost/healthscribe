CLI tool powered by Python to leverage AWS HealthScribe service

Desired workflow
- `python3 main <AUDIO_FILE_PATH>` Send audio file to HealthScribe, and receive the transcription and summary back

TODO
- Build CLI tool that can fulfil desired workflow
- Investigate - can we have a phone app that takes local recordings, sends them to HealthScribe, and receives HealthScribe output back on the phone?
